        <h2 class="white">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
        <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p>“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h2 class="white">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>

        <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

        <h2 class="black">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

        <p class="white-back">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br/> never written a line of code. I needed<br/> some structure from 
        professionals<br/> who can help me learn programming<br/> step by step. I was encouraged to<br/> enroll by a former 
        student of theirs<br/> who can only say wonderful things<br/> about the program. The entire<br/> curriculum and staff 
        did not<br/> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br/> and I never had to wait long for<br/> assistance. The agile team 
        project, in<br/> particular, was outstanding. It took<br/> my learning to the next level in a way<br/> that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In<br/> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br/> interviews as an example of my<br/> developent 
        experience. It certainly<br/> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br/> developer after receiving multiple<br/> offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</p>
